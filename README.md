# Scheme Interpreter

## Background

First of all, the project is still running. It's one of my side projects. Although I am focusing on CV and AI recently, I still have the passion to learn nwe stuff.

As a programmer, my daily life is developing and dealing with algorithms and software. And the Interpreters and compilers are so essential. To be straightforward, the compiler is a translator which translates the codes that wrote by programmers to the codes that machines understand. The interpreter does not only translate the codes and execute them.

The project is trying to interprete a programming language(Scheme) with another high-level programming language(C++). And there are at least 3 advantages:

1. Be familiar with the new programming language which was picked to be interpreted, such as Scheme.
2. Understand how the compiler and interpreter translate codes. The point is not to focus on how they make high-level programming language become binary code or machine code.
3. Follow up on the language that I have been familiar with.
